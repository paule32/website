<p>
<i>Effective Date of Policy: May 1, 2018</i></p>
<p>
Welcome! Below you will find the privacy policy for Common Sense Media, Inc. ("we" or "us").<br>
We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we obtain <br>
from you with care and respect. The Common Sense Media Privacy Policy (the "Policy" or <br>
the "Privacy Policy") is designed to answer your questions regarding how we collect, protect, <br>
use and share information obtained through the Common Sense Media website, www.commonsensemedia.org<br>
(the "Site"), other Common Sense Media websites, the Common Sense Media mobile application and <br>
other applications ("apps") that we operate and that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, <br>
the "Services"). <br>
Common Sense Media also maintains other websites and apps, which are governed by their own privacy<br>
policies. If you are using another Common Sense Media website or app, please be sure to consult<br>
the applicable privacy policy, as it may differ from this Policy. We hope this information increases<br>
your confidence in Common Sense Media and enhances your experience on our Services.</p>
<p>
Please see our separate Terms of Use, which governs the use of the Services. We encourage you to <br>
read this Policy before using the Services, and not to use the Services if you disagree with any <br>
part of this Policy. By using the Services or by clicking a box that states that you accept or <br>
agree to this Policy, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy.</p/
<p>
The Services are controlled and operated by Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization in the <br>
United States, and are not intended to subject Common Sense Media or any affiliated entity to the <br>
laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States. <br>
We may limit the availability of the Services, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic <br>
area or jurisdiction we choose, at any time in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>
<b>I. INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES</b></p>
<p>
Through the Services, you can be a part of an active and vibrant community of families and educators<br>
interested in the impact of media on their children and students. Visitors who complete the <br>
membership process through our Services may become registered members ("Members"). <br>
Members can engage in a full range of activities on our Services, such as posting comments on articles, <br>
creating user reviews on media products, participating in surveys and polls, and saving favorites to <br>
a personal page. Educator members, in addition to creating user reviews, can participate in educator <br>
forums. If you are not currently a Member, you may click here to register, or here if you are an educator,<br>
and become eligible for our Services' features.</p>

<p><b>A. Personal Information</b></p>
<p>
In this Policy, when we use the term "Personal Information", we mean any information that can be used <br>
to identify or contact a specific individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, email address <br>
and telephone number. <br>
We collect different types of Personal Information depending on whether you are a Non-Member or a Member, <br>
and what type of Member you are, as explained below. Personal Information does not include screen names <br>
(also known as member names, usernames or other online aliases) provided by our adult users in the course <br>
of registering with or using the Services. For information on the collection, use and disclosure of children's<br>
personal information, please see our Children's Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
Visitors to the Services may register and opt-in to receive Common Sense Media email newsletters<br>
by providing their email address and zip code (child members under 13 cannot opt-in for this email <br>
newsletter). We also may collect Personal Information through surveys or questionnaires. <br>
Your participation in surveys and questionnaires is entirely voluntary.</p>
<p>
If you wish to become a Member, you must provide us with certain Personal Information as part of the<br>
registration process, including, for example, name, email address, school information (for educators), <br>
password and age range. We additionally ask for zip code. If the Member is under the age of 18, we do not <br>
ask for name or zip code, but we do ask for birthdate information (month and year only).</p>
<p>
If you wish to become a Member, you may optionally choose to provide us with certain additional <br>
information, such as country of residence. If you are a parent or adult Member, you may also optionally<br>
choose to provide us with information about your children such as their ages and names so we can <br>
personalize your experience on the Services and within our email newsletters.</p>
<p>
In order to simplify our registration and login process, we provide you with the option to register or <br>
login and link your Member account on the Site with a third-party social networking service, <br>
such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter (each a "Social Networking Service"). These services will <br>
authenticate your identity, will allow you to log into the Services using the single social login <br>
buttons, and will share certain personal information that you allow us to collect, as discussed below.</p>
<p>
If you wish to become an Educator Member on the Site, you must provide us with your school name or <br>
select that you're not an Educator in a school and select your Educator type.</p>
<p>
If you provide us with your name on your public user profile ("Profile") page, your first name and<br>
the first initial of your last name will be displayed on your Profile page and next to any reviews or <br>
comments that you post on our Site. Non-Educator Members have the option to not display your name and we <br>
will instead display your screen name which can be an anonymous name of your choice.</p>
<p>
Your screen name identifies you on the Services if you opt-out of using your name or do not provide us <br>
with that information. For instance, your screen name is included in your Profile that is viewable by <br>
other Members and is displayed with reviews and comments that you write. Since the screen name is viewable<br>
by others, we suggest that you NOT use your real name for your screen name or your password, in order to <br>
protect your privacy.</p>
<p>
If you decide that you no longer want to be a Member, you can delete your account at any time. To delete <br>
your account, login to your account, visit your My Account page (My Profile page for Educators), and then <br>
click the "Close my Account" link located towards the bottom of the page. Once you delete your account, all <br>
of your Personal Information stored in your account and Profile on our site will be removed. <br>
If you have posted any reviews or comments, you may choose at the time you close your account to <br>
delete them as well, or you can choose to have them remain on the site, but the author name will <br>
switch to "anonymous" so your name will no longer be connected with your content. Or, you can contact <br>
us at privacy@commonsense.org and request that we delete your content (including reviews) and account <br>
for you.</p>
<p>
If you decide that you would like your posted reviews or comments deleted from our Services, you can <br>
do this at any time by logging into your account, viewing the review or comment, and clicking the "delete" <br>
button. You can also send us an email at privacy@commonsense.org with your screen name, date of <br>
submitted review or comment, and title of media type that was reviewed. Please note that your request <br>
or deletion does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, <br>
for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.</p>
<p>
It is possible that Personal Information and other data that you furnished through the Services may <br>
remain in our system (such as in backups of the Services' data), even if you are no longer a Member,<br>
and can be used by us in accordance with this Policy. <br>
PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU <br>
DISCLOSE IN YOUR PROFILE OR ON PUBLIC-FACING AREAS OF THE SERVICES.</p>
<p>
We may receive your Personal Information from other sources, such as Common Sense events, <br>
Common Sense education partners, activity on Common Sense social media platforms, and public databases.</p>
<p>
<b>B. Collection of Information by Our Service Providers</b></p>
<p>
We use a third-party service provider (the "Payment Service"), to handle donations made by credit card <br>
and other payment transactions submitted to our Services. If you wish to make a donation through the<br>
Services, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service<br>
(or its service providers) and not by us (such page, the "Payment Service Page"). <br>
Any Personal Information that you provide through the Payment Service Page will be collected directly <br>
by the Payment Service rather than by us, and will be subject to the Payment Service's privacy policy <br>
rather than this Policy. <br>
We have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, the Payment Service's use of information <br>
collected through the Payment Service Page.<br>
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH <br>
THE PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT SERVICE.</p>
<p>
<b>C. Cookies and Other Technologies</b></p>
<p>
We and third parties who provide services to us may also collect certain information automatically<br>
when you visit the Services, including through the use of cookies and web beacons, such as the browser <br>
you are using (e.g., Safari, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.), the internet address from <br>
which you linked to the Services, the operating system of your computer (e.g., Microsoft Windows, iOS, <br>
Android, etc.), the unique IP address of the computer you used to access our Services and usage and <br>
browsing habits. We use this information to administer and improve your experience on our Services, <br>
to help diagnose and troubleshoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather use and demographic <br>
information. Some of these third parties may use this information for other purposes.</p>
<p>
The following page lists our third-party service providers who may use cookies and other technologies.</p>
<p>
To help make sure you receive information that is relevant to you, our Services use "cookies," <br>
which are small data files stored on your computer and identify you as a previous visitor to the <br>
Services and help us to personalize your experience when you arrive. Most web browsers are set to accept <br>
cookies. You can instruct your browser not to accept cookies. However, if you disable this function, <br>
you will not be able to use some of the features on our Services.</p>
<p>
Our web pages and our e-mail newsletters may contain "web beacons." Web beacons are small pieces of<br>
data embedded with images on pages of the Services or in emails, which allow us to collect information <br>
such as the number of users that have visited a web page or opened an email. We use web beacons to measure <br>
the effectiveness of our content and campaigns and how visitors use our Services. <br>
This allows us to learn what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which parts of our Services <br>
are the most interesting and what kind of offers our visitors like to see.</p>
<p>
<b>D. Non-Personal Information</b></p>
<p>
Non-Personal Information is aggregated information, demographic information, high-level location <br>
information, such as the browser language and country during the user session, and other information <br>
that does not reveal a person's specific identity. We may collect Non-Personal Information <br>
(e.g., interests, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us, such as through survey <br>
responses. Such information constitutes Non-Personal Information because, unless combined with your <br>
name or other Personal Information, it does not personally identify you or any other user.</p>
<p>
Additionally, we may aggregate Personal Information in such a manner that the end product does not <br>
personally identify you or any other user of the Services. For example, we might use Personal Information <br>
to calculate the percentage of our Members who live in a particular state. Such aggregate information <br>
is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Policy.</p>
<p>
<b>II. HOW WE USE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE</b></p>
<p>
<b>A. How We Use Personal Information</b></p>
<p>
We use Personal Information to process requests made through our Services, such as requests to receive<br>
our e-newsletters, requests for membership and questions or comments submitted through our Services. <br>
You may opt-out of receiving our e-newsletters at any time by updating your subscription selection in <br>
the "My Profile" section of your account, clicking the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of <br>
all newsletters, or by visiting commonsense.org/contact and sending a request using our online form.</p>
<p>
Fulfillment of Requests. We may use Personal Information about you to fulfill the purpose for which <br>
such information was provided (e.g., to send newsletters to you or respond to your requests or <br>
inquiries and provide related customer service).</p>
<p>
Additional Communications. If you register to become a Member of our community or sign up to receive <br>
one of our e-newsletters, we may use the Personal Information submitted in connection with your <br>
application to contact you with surveys or important communications regarding Common Sense Media. <br>
We may additionally use Personal Information to contact you about Common Sense content, features, <br>
opportunities, and products that may be of interest to you.</p>
<p>
Membership. If you become a Member, we may use your Personal Information to maintain and update your <br>
Profile and postings in our online reviews, surveys and polls. All content that you submit to the <br>
Services is governed by our Terms of Use. We may also use Personal Information to send updates and <br>
communications to our Members, such as our e-newsletters, surveys and other important Common Sense Media <br>
communications such as information regarding the Services or changes to our terms, conditions and policies.</p>
<p>
Internal Operations and Analysis. We may also use Personal Information about you for our internal business <br>
purposes, such as data analysis, audits, enhancing or modifying our products and services, and so forth.</p>
<p>
We may also use Personal Information to personalize your experience on the Services by presenting content <br>
and market opportunities and products tailored to you and to allow you to participate in sweepstakes, <br>
contests and similar promotions and to administer these activities.</p>
<p>
<b>B. How We Use Information Collected Via Cookies and Other Technologies</b></p>
<p>
We use information collected via cookies, web beacons and other technologies as described above, under <br>
"Cookies and Other Technologies."</p>
<p>
<b>C. How We Use Non-Personal Information</b></p>
<p>
Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use or disclose such <br>
information for any purpose. For instance, we may compile and share aggregate data about the <br>
geographic locations or other demographics of our Members, provided that this information does <br>
not personally identify any of these Members.</p>
<p>
<b>III. HOW WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SERVICES</b></p>
<p>
Except as expressly provided in this Policy, we will not share any Personal<br>
Information about you without your prior consent.</p>
<p>
Profile Information. Each Member has a Profile on the Site, which includes the Member's <br>
name or screen name, Member photo (through social login only), Member type, registration<br>
date, and links to the Member's posted reviews and comments. You can change or remove any<br>
information from your Profile (except for your screen name) by logging into the Site and<br>
clicking the "My Account" or "My Profile" links located in your personal Account section.</p>
<p>
Your Posted Reviews and Comments. If you post reviews, comments or ratings on our Site, the<br>
contents of those postings may be displayed on our Site along with your name (first name,<br>
and first initial of last name) or screen name, Member photo (through social login only),<br>
Member type, age (if under 18 years of age) and school information (if you are an educator).<br>
The ages of your kids may also be displayed if you provide this information and allow it to<br>
be posted (this information can also be selected to remain private).</p>
<p>
Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training. For Educator users who complete our<br>
Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training, if requested by your school district, <br>
we may share your first and last name, school name, and completion date. The purpose of sharing<br>
this data is to help your district understand which teachers have received instruction on the<br>
Common Sense curriculum. Additionally, if your school receives E-rate support, it will help<br>
your district comply with CIPA.</p>
<p>
Third Party Service Providers. We work with third parties who provide services such as data<br>
analysis, payment or donation processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision,<br>
information technology services, content personalization, email delivery services, and market<br>
research or third parties who provide other services to help improve or operate our Services.<br>
We may share Personal Information about you with third parties solely for the purpose of<br>
enabling them to provide these services to us. These service providers are given access to<br>
Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but are restricted from using the<br>
Personal Information for purposes other than providing services for us.</p>
<p>
Social Login: If you choose to register or login to the Services through a Social Networking<br>
Service, we will ask you for your permission to access your data on the Social Networking Service<br>
to create an account and Profile. In addition, we may use this data for several purposes, including:
<ul>
    <li>Populating Account and Profile Fields: When you are connected via a Social Networking <br>
        Service, we will pre-populate and update your account and Profile fields with data from <br>

        at any time on your Account and Profile pages.</li>
    <li>Personalizing the Services: When you are connected via a Social Networking Service, we may<br>
        personalize the Services experience by displaying your name (first name, and first initial<br>
        of last name) and profile picture or avatar (which you can choose to not display and instead<br>
        show your anonymous screen name and no image) on your public profile page, next to your<br>
        posted reviews and comments, or on other areas of the site where your posted content is<br>
        displayed. We might also display lists of content for you that similar users also like.<br>
        We may additionally use information from your social media profile or your social media<br>
        activities on our Services to personalize content for you and offer features and <br>
        opportunities tailored to your interests.</li>
    <li>Aggregate Reporting: When you are connected via a Social Networking Service, we may use data<br>
        from the Social Networking Service that you allow us to access to learn more about the <br>
        demographic information of our users.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
You may disconnect from a linked Social Networking Service at any time by visiting the<br>
"My Account" or "My Profile" section of the Site.</p>
<p>
We will not share any information about you collected on the Services with a linked Social <br>
Networking Service without your approval. This means that we will not post anything to your <br>
Facebook wall, Google account, or Twitter feed unless you give us specific permission to do so,<br>
and we will not contact your friends or followers at any time. We do not store or utilize the names<br>
of your friends or followers even if they are passed to us by a social sign-on service in the initial<br>
registration process.</p>
<p>
Social Networking Services provide varying levels of control over the extent to which content or<br>
information you submit to the Services is also made public and shared on linked Social Networking<br>
Services. When you use a Social Networking Service to log into the Services:
<ul>
    <li><b>You share your information with it and its privacy policy applies to the Social Networking<br>
         Service's collection, use, and disclosure of such information.</b></li>
    <li>In addition, the Social Networking Service may be able to collect information about you,<br>
        including your activity on the Services, and it may notify your connections on the Social <br>
        Networking Service about your use of the Services.</li>
    <li>Such services may also employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored<br>
        across multiple websites for purposes of delivering targeted advertising to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>

different from our own and we encourage you to read them. We also encourage you to familiarize <br>
yourself with the privacy controls and account settings on linked Social Networking Services for <br>
information on how to customize your privacy settings with respect to content or information submitted<br>
to the Services.</p>
<p>
Law Enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the<br>
contrary, we reserve the right to use your Personal Information, and to disclose it to others, as we<br>

(b) to comply with legal process,<br>
(c) to respond to governmental requests, <br>
(d) to enforce our Terms of Service, <br>
(e) to protect our operations, <br>
(f) for assistance in fraud detection and prevention; <br>

(i) in connection with a disposition of all or a substantial portion of our business, assets or<br>
stock, such as the sale of the Site or Services, a merger, consolidation, reorganization, <br>
joint venture, assignment, or bankruptcy or similar proceedings.
</p>
<p><b>IV. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b></p>
<p>
To learn about our practices regarding children's personal information, please read<br>
our Children's Privacy Policy. When we intend to collect children's personal information,<br>
we take additional steps to protect children's privacy, including:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to children;</li>
    <li>Limiting our collection of children's personal information to no more than is<br>
        reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and</li>
    <li>Providing parents with access to, and the ability to request changes to or<br>
        deletion of, children's personal information that we have collected.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>V. Donor Privacy Policy</b></p>

At Common Sense, we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of our donors.<br>
We are dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal information we <br>
obtain from you with care and respect.
<p>
We are not in the business of renting, selling, or trading our donors’ names or personal <br>
information, nor of sending mailings to our donors on behalf of other organizations. If this<br>
should ever change, we would only do so with your prior consent.</p>
<p>
We may use third-party service providers to provide certain services on our behalf, including<br>
to process donations. To the extent that any third-party service provider is used to process<br>
donations, that service provider has assured Common Sense it will not use personal donor<br>
information for any purpose other than what is necessary to process the gift transaction for<br>
Common Sense.<br>
And any additional service providers, such as email providers, are given access to personal <br>
donor information only as needed to provide their functions for Common Sense.<p>
</p>
<p>
This policy applies to all donor personal information received by Common Sense, both online <br>
and offline, on any Platform ("Platform", includes the Common Sense website and mobile<br>
applications), as well as through any electronic, written, or oral communications.</p>

<p><b>VI. IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES, PRACTICES AND CONTACT INFORMATION</b>
</p>
Links. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy,<br>
information or other practices of any third party, including any third party operating<br>
any site or service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link on the Services<br>
does not imply our endorsement of the linked site or service. In addition, we are not<br>
responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies and<br>
practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google Analytics and reCAPTCHA,<br>
Microsoft, RIM or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider,<br>
operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer.<br>
<p>
Security. We seek to use reasonable administrative, organizational, technical, and physical<br>
measures to help protect the Personal Information you provide to us. Unfortunately, no data <br>
transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe<br>
that your interaction with us is no longer secure, you should immediately notify us in accordance<br>
with the section below entitled "Contacting Us." Please note that if you notify us by physical mail,<br>
this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.</p>
<br>
Updating Your Personal Information. If you are a Member, you can update your Personal Information<br>
at any time by accessing your account. To do this, just click on the "My Account", "My Profile" or<br>

</p><p>
Please note we are unable to update or delete any of your Personal Information<br>
that has been shared with a third party as permitted in this Policy or with your<br>
consent. Also, please note that we may need to retain certain information for<br>
recordkeeping purposes, and there also may be some residual information that will<br>
remain within our databases and other records (such as in backups of the Site's data),<br>
which may not be removed.
</p><p>
<i>Changes to the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this<br>
Policy, and any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our<br>
posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Services following<br>
such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect.<br>
